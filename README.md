# dicom-imref3d
DICOM image reading, supporting easy geometric transformation between series.

Read3DSeriesFolder reads 3D DICOM image series. See demo_fusion script for example of usage.

Read4DSeriesFolder reads 4D DICOM image series. See demo_multiparametric script for example of use with ADC.

ReadRTSTRUCTMasks reads DICOM-RT struture sets as 3D binary masks. See demo_contours script for example of usage.

Requires MATLAB Image Processing Toolbox.
